## Background
Hello!

My name is Fabi√°n Leal. A little bit about me: I did my undergraduate at Universidad de Chile where I majored in Industrial Engineering and did a Masters in Operations Research, both focused on data science and applied mathematics. I had many programming assignments and participated in some extracurricular projects that I included in this repository. 

I recently started working as a Data Analytics Consultant at a B2B Workforce Management Consulting firm, where I help other companies improve their workforce planning by analyzing their data, gathering insights, and proposing/programming solutions for whatever problems I may find!

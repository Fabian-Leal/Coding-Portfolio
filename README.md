# Fabian Leal -  Projects Portfolio 
## Index
This repository holds some of my personal projects that I've done since I started working at the end of my undergrad. Currently they're binned in two different categories:

1. Data Science PhD intensive modules

2. Programming Projects for work at SCM LATAM
  

## Background
Hello!

My name is Fabi√°n Leal. A little bit about me: I did my undergraduate at Universidad de Chile where I majored in Industrial Engineering and did a Masters in Operations Research, both focused on data science and applied mathematics.

At the end of my undergraduate degree, I started working as a Data Analytics Consultant at a B2B Workforce Management Consulting firm, where I helped other companies improve their workforce planning by analyzing their data, gathering insights, and proposing/programming solutions to their problems. Only the parts that I coded are made public in section 2 (the main.py), to protect the intellectual property of SCM LATAM.

I noticed that I was spending most of my time doing applied data science, and that this was the part of my job that I liked the most, so I decided to start a data science PhD program in the University of Western Australia, in collaboration with the DARE centre, which applies data science to natural resources problems. This starts with a twelve week intensive program in data science. We work on programming tasks every week, but only my solutions to the monthly assessments will be made public, in order to protect the intellectual property of the DARE centre.
